- Expand the note input area for longer content.
- View a list of all created notes.
- Delete notes when they are no longer needed.

## Components

### `App`

The main component that orchestrates the entire app. It manages the state of the notes and renders the Header, CreateArea, Note, and Footer components.

### `CreateArea`

This component handles the creation of new notes. It contains input fields for the note's title and content. It also allows expanding the input area for longer content. When the "Add" button is clicked, the note is added to the list of notes.

### `Note`

Displays an individual note with its title, content, and a delete button. Clicking the delete button removes the note from the list.

## Dependencies

The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It doesn't rely on any external UI frameworks or libraries. The Material-UI components have been commented out in the code, but you can uncomment them if you wish to use Material-UI styling and icons.
